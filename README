JE, version 0.002

JE is a pure-Perl ECMAScript (JavaScript) engine.

This is still a pre-alpha release. You can't actually *use* it yet.
About the only things you can do with it so far are:
  - concatenate strings
  - add numbers
  - create arrays and objects with literals
  - refer to global properties with identifiers
  - refer to the global object with the 'this' keyword

If  you have the time and the interest,  please experiment with this
module. If you have any ideas as to how the API could be improved or
reworked, please e-mail me.
