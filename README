JE, version 0.001

JE is a pure-Perl ECMAScript (JavaScript) engine.

This is still a pre-alpha release. You can't actually *use* it yet.
About the only thing it can do so far is concatenate strings.

If  you have the time and the interest,  please experiment with this
module. If you have any ideas as to how the API could be improved or
reworked, please e-mail me.

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.
