JE, version 0.003

JE is a pure-Perl ECMAScript (JavaScript) engine.

This is still an alpha release. All JavaScript literals (except func-
tions), identifiers and operators are now supported.

If  you have the time and the interest,  please experiment with this
module. If you have any ideas as to how the API could be improved or
reworked, please e-mail me.


TO DO

- Add support for all types of statements (currently only expression
  statements work)
- Finish the core object classes
- Implement exception handling and helpful error messages
- Write lots and lots and lots of tests, at the same time fixing all
  the bugs they bring to light
- Perhaps make it easier to bind Perl classes to JavaScript
