JE, version 0.004

JE is a pure-Perl ECMAScript (JavaScript) engine.

This is still an alpha release. All JavaScript syntax should be parsed
and executed correctly now. The core objects are not yet complete.

If  you have the time and the interest,  please experiment with this
module. If you have any ideas as to how the API could be improved or
reworked, please e-mail me.


TO DO

- Finish the core object classes
- Implement exception handling and helpful error messages
- Write lots and lots and lots of tests, at the same time fixing all
  the bugs they bring to light.
- Verify that tainted JS code runs safely
- Deal with circular references somehow
- Optimise JS functions by turning them into Perl subs (but run benchmarks
  first to see whether this would actually speed things up)
