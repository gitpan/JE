Revision history for JE

        Alpha release. All JavaScript operators are now supported. JS
        numbers now use Perl's nan and inf.  A few bugs in the object
        classes have been fixed.  A bug preventing the  expansion  of
        backslash escapes in string literals has been fixed.

        Still a pre-alpha version with almost no features and lots of
        bugs. A lot of work has been done on the object classes.  The
        parser is half-written,  but the code that actually  executes
        the parse tree is far from complete.  The only really noticea-
        ble new features are that array and object literals and  iden-
        tifiers are now parsed and interpreted.

0.001   24 January, 2007
        Pre-alpha version,  with almost no features and lots of  bugs.
        The man pages describe many features that have not been imple-
        mented, so it's all just talk.
