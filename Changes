Revision history for JE

0.005   5 March, 2007
        Alpha release. Changes and additions:
        - The parser has been rewritten completely with recursive sub-
          routines.  It is now faster than before,  and doesn't cause
          bus errors.
        - The Error and SyntaxError classes now actually work. Before
          I just threw them together without even testing them.
        - The Object constructor is now according to spec.
	- URI-handling functions and the URIError class
        - Added the rest of Object.prototype's properties

0.004   19 February, 2007
        Alpha release. New features and bug fixes in this
        release include:
        - Support for all JavaScript statements, not just expression
          statements
        - JE::String now provides a desurrogify function.
        - JE::upgrade now supports coderefs and makes '0' into a num-
          ber, as the docs say it does.
        - The JE::new_function method has been added.
        - Overloading for JE::LValue objects
        - JE::Object::props now returns the names of the object's pro-
          totype's properties as well as the object's own
        - Error and SyntaxError classes
        - Function literals and declarations
        - '==' in JS now does string comparison if at least one oper-
          and is a string  (it used to determine that it  should  do
          string  comparison  and  then  do  numeric  equals  anyway,
          because I typed '==' by mistake instead of 'eq'!)

0.003   14 February, 2007
        Alpha release. All JavaScript operators are now supported. JS
        numbers now use Perl's nan and inf.  A few bugs in the object
        classes have been fixed.  A bug preventing the  expansion  of
        backslash escapes in string literals has been fixed.

0.002   7 February, 2007
        Still a pre-alpha version with almost no features and lots of
        bugs. A lot of work has been done on the object classes.  The
        parser is half-written,  but the code that actually  executes
        the parse tree is far from complete.  The only really noticea-
        ble new features are that array and object literals and  iden-
        tifiers are now parsed and interpreted.

0.001   24 January, 2007
        Pre-alpha version,  with almost no features and lots of  bugs.
        The man pages describe many features that have not been imple-
        mented, so it's all just talk.
